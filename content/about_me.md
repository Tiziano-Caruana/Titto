# About me

I'm currently delving into the world of web security, primarily through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions with my team, TRX, and various platforms offering diverse challenges on the subject.

I often enjoy writing writeups on challenges that I found fun or interesting for some reason. I dedicate several hours to their drafting, striving to make them as understandable as possible even for inexperienced individuals who have only a vague idea of how the internet works.

I firmly believe that theoretical study should be complemented and stimulated by both practical application of skills and the presentation of compelling stories and current events. I think that people are more likely to grasp even complex technical concepts if they help better understand the workings of infrastructures and systems that have recently been victims of attacks or errors.

It's utopian to think that such learning can be applied in a school or university setting, perhaps impractical. That's why I believe it's important for every individual to dedicate themselves without hesitation to their passions outside of school hours. What is taught in schools, in any institution and regarding any subject, is little more than the bare minimum necessary to not be considered completely ignorant of the topics presented.

I would like to share this message with as many people as possible to help those who, like me, want to explore the world of cybersecurity. I know I still have a lot to learn, both technically and pedagogically. I'm striving to grow not only by gaining experience in different contexts but also by improving my communication skills and becoming more helpful to others.
