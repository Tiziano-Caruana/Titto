# About me

Currently, I am delving deeper into the world of cybersecurity. After competing in CTFs with the TRX team for two years, Iâ€™ve started participating in other types of cybersecurity competitions, exploring the communicative side and gaining insights into typical attacker behavior.

Whenever I can, I enjoy writing blog posts and articles, whether for the communities I'm part of or to participate in a new competition. I believe that by dedicating several hours to creating high-quality content, I can make my work as informed and understandable as possible, even for people who only have a vague idea of how internet systems and actors operate.

I firmly believe that theoretical study should be complemented and stimulated by both practical application of skills and the presentation of compelling stories and current events. I think that people are more likely to grasp even complex technical concepts if they help better understand the workings of infrastructures and systems that have recently been victims of attacks or errors.

It's utopian to think that such learning can be applied in a school or university setting, perhaps impractical. That's why I believe it's important for every individual to dedicate themselves without hesitation to their passions outside of school hours. What is taught in schools, in any institution and regarding any subject, is little more than the bare minimum necessary to not be considered completely ignorant of the topics presented.

I would like to share this message with as many people as possible to help those who, like me, want to explore the world of cybersecurity. I know I still have a lot to learn, both technically and pedagogically. I'm striving to grow not only by gaining experience in different contexts but also by improving my communication skills and becoming more helpful to others.
