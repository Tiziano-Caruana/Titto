Hi, I'm Tiziano Caruana, an 18-year-old guy from Rome. Here's some information about me:

- **Interests**: back-end development, cybersecurity, CTF, gym, walking (ðŸ‘´).
- **Education**: technical high-school in computer science.
- **Work experience**:
  - Internship as a database developer, summer 2021
  - Internship at a start-up as a cloud developer, summer-fall 2022.
- **National cybersecurity competitions:**
  - **OliCyber**: I participated in the Italian Cybersecurity Olympiad, qualifying for the finals in the 2022/23 edition.
  - **CyberChallenge.it**: in the 2023 edition, I managed to be selected among the 20 chosen by Sapienza for training, and I won the national final with the university team.
- **TRX**: I am a member of [TRX](https://theromanxpl0it.github.io/) (TheRomanXpl0it), the CTF team of Sapienza. I mainly solve web challenges, but I try to help the team in misc (OSINT/geoguessing) and forensics (mem dumps).

# My story

![Maybe I'm not the thinker](https://media.tenor.com/kOJnwQX83BQAAAAd/bro-thinks-hes-the-thinker-bro-thinking.gif)

I started dealing with computers when I was 7 years old, when my parents couldn't understand what was written in troubleshooting manuals. So I had my first experience with network operations and some anglicisms.

At 12, I chose to enroll in a technical institute specializing in computer science, even though I had neither the knowledge nor the means to understand what this world included, and I had never dealt with half a line of code, so I pretty much decided at random.

Two years later, I became passionate about the world of video games thanks to a psychological horror called Doki Doki Literature Club, which plays with your computer files to make you lose a few years of life. I was fascinated by the experience and decided to figure out how such a game could be created.

After a year spent on Ren'Py, creating mods for DDLC and mini-games, I realized how little I liked the artistic process behind software creation, compared to writing backend code itself. From here, after witnessing the slowness of progress in computer science lessons, I decided to deepen this world on my own.

In the summer of 2021, I did an internship as a database developer, where I acquired new skills and realized how much I liked this world. I then did an internship at a start-up as a cloud developer between summer and fall 2022, where I had the opportunity to understand the differences between personal projects and real-world enterprise software.

In September 2021, while browsing Instagram, I discovered the Italian Cybersecurity Olympiad, dedicated to high school students. Despite knowing nothing about cybersecurity, I spent two months behind my school tutors and the school presidency in order to get us enrolled in the competitions. After passing the territorial phase, I was eliminated in the regional phase by only two positions.

In the 2022 edition of OliCyber, I qualified for the finals and had the opportunity to participate in the training camp at the Campus ITC ILO in Turin. Even though I had little time to improve my skills, the experience of being among many other motivated and skilled kids gave me great motivation.

In the 2023 edition of CyberChallenge.it, I managed to be selected among the 20 chosen by Sapienza for training. In the local competition, I came in sixth place, a result that allowed me to enter the university team with which I then won the national final.

Although I still feel like a novice in many areas, I realize how much progress I have made so far and how much I can still improve.
