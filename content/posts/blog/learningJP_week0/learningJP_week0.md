While I was browsing the internet looking for inspiring stories of how people started to actually make progress in Japanese understanding and/or conversational skills, I found quite a lot of cool blog articles structured as monthly, weekly, or even daily public diaries!

I found it inspiring and decided to replicate the idea on my nearly-empty blog.

I'm not gonna lie, it's been a long time since I wrote a piece of writing fully in English. AI really made me lazy and my weak spots in this language, being writing + use of English, are starting to scare me.

This is my little attempt at achieving several goals at once:
- Brush up my English writing skills (which are already stuck at a lower C1 level üò≠);
- Give me motivation to continue learning Japanese and studying for uni;
- Take care of my blog and add content that I like;
- Tracking my progress and leaving a mark of who I am to my future self.

Not bad!

## My "why"s
I feel like I'm at a major crossroad of my lifepath. I'll be going to Tokyo as an exchange student in a few months and the hardest exam session of my bachelor's is starting in a week.

I'll have to prepare for an exam I‚Äôve already skipped twice due to burnout (Calculus 1... yeah... everyone has their weak points I guess -.-), and in early December, I tried the same strategy again: just focus on studying calculus and physical training, and you'll get to the goal. After 2 days of doing absolutely nothing, I realized the same vicious cycle was beginning again. It's ironic, considering that I already passed Calculus 2 earlier in the semester ü§î

I tried to think about it, and I realized that when I passed some exams that I considered unfriendly I wasn't focusing 100% on them: I passed "probability and statistics" while I was still playing a lot of CTFs, and "algebra and geometry" while doing some traveling.

Learning Japanese can be a great way to distract my brain when I'm feeling bored and tired. "Just go out", you say. **The outer world won't get me just yet**

I felt like I had to start learning it anyway before arriving in Japan. I'll get a chance to know a lot of native Japanese speakers, and wasting most of that time figuring out the writing system and language basics would be a huge waste. I also want to apply to a Japanese level 2 class at my hosting university instead of the introductory one.

Yeah, I never really thought of learning Japanese before, and I think it is also because I never had an opportunity like this. I've engaged daily with Japanese culture (music, animation, films) for years now, but never felt the need to learn it like I do now.

Blog posting will help me realize if something is not working like I would like to, letting me adjust some things on the run to re-establish some kind of balance in my routine.

## Week 0

## Friday - planning my time
Today I picked up calculus theory and Japanese again.

I have 35 theorems and 38 groups of definitions to learn for my exam, which will take place on the 23rd of January. I estimated to cover all the topics in 20 days, while I'll cover every type of practical exercise a bit earlier in order to start practicing on previous exams. The categories of exercises that I can find in the exams are:

- Limits and Taylor series
- Sequences and series
- Derivatives
- Integrals
- Study of functions

I'll have to take care of 4 theory points a day on average (without forgetting them later), and learn one group of exercises every 3 days. It will be a crazy run!

I know this would be impossible. Given that I didn't study the theory for a month, I'll not revise the concepts that I can still explain perfectly after all this time. Today I didn't manage to go through all of the content I studied before, but I did exclude a bunch of questions (8 groups of concepts and 3 theorems). I'll have a better idea of my planned workload tomorrow.

I had a motivational blast today with Japanese. To my sad surprise, I didn't remember all of the hiragana and almost none of the katakana, so I'll have to start over... Thanks to my motivation tho, I managed to learn the numbers from 0 to 9999 and to write them in hiragana, so I think I'm set to see some significant progress in the days to come.

I picked up the "[Japanese from zero! 1](https://www.fromzero.com/books)" book. I like it before it introduces a lot of vocabulary and makes me feel like I know how and when to use the sentences I'm learning. I believe that the target of the book is pretty young tho, so Hiragana is introduced a bit late. I'm considering learning it on the side or dedicating a full day to it to master it.

I want to take the next few days to familiarize myself with all of the new inputs and stress. I won't have a strict schedule, I'll just work keeping in mind that I should spend slightly more time learning calculus than Japanese. I won't force any kind of learning method in either of the two spheres. I'll follow my instincts and see what I have to keep and what I should change to keep the balance.

It'll be 3 AM in a few minutes, time to go to sleep!

## Saturday - recapture the past
### 3 AM
After revising all of the calculus content I previously studied, I decided to remove 6 theorems and 11 groups of definitions, leaving me with 29 theorems and 27 groups of definitions, a total of 56 topics. I didn't remember all of the definitions I removed, but I'm pretty confident that I'll learn them better while dealing with the exercises (they were topics related to limits and function-specific behaviors).

I dealt with the theory from 12:15 to 14:45, but I revised while chilling and listening to music, and I had to buy some groceries for my mom and cook me something and eat it for lunch, so I definitely wasn't efficient but I'm still pretty motivated. 

Now I'll just wait for some family members to come, have a chat with them, and then try out some exercises about limits to see where was I before quitting.

### 9:30 PM
I waited for the guests to leave, hit a quick workout in the gym, did one hour of math, had dinner and modified my Steam profile and POOF, 6 hours and an half have passed. 

I'm quite satisfied with what I'm doing, the calculus exercises are going well and maybe I'll complete an online tutorial I'm following before tomorrow's end. I think I'll go forward a bit, take a shower, and then see where I'm at. I'd also like to play videogames and my Japanese session of the day is yet to start. [MiSide](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527500/MiSide/) is waiting for me! I also want to start [No Case Should Remain Unsolved](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2676840/No_Case_Should_Remain_Unsolved/), I already bought it, but I'll start playing it later on.

### 2 AM
I just found out that I can use ALT+Z on VSCode to word wrap mode...

I stopped practicing calculus when I started to feel tired and repeatedly made silly mistakes, ending the day with 2 hours studying theory and 2 hours practicing exercises.

I have to say that learning Japanese is already starting to feel like a daunting task. I'll stick to trying to memorize new words and shadowing simple sentences.

I think I've also been handicapped by being already fatigued from calculus, but I made some solid progress. I memorized all of the sentences I came across - they were all things I already heard from anime xd - but had some trouble with remembering bedroom and bath vocabulary, and body parts. I created a new Anki deck about those words. I never really stick to Anki, but I want to give it a third chance by creating my own decks and taking my time. 

There's a high risk I won't have much time tomorrow: my family has guests at dinner and I'll have to clean my room and help my mom with the cooking. Maybe I'll manage to study for 5 hours or so, and considering that I'll also have to take some breaks and inefficiency moments, I'll set this goals for tomorrow:

- 3 theorems and 1 group of theory
- Finishing Elia Bombardelli's YouTube series about limits
- Fulling the hiragana quiz at least once
- Finishing the Japanese from Zero pre-lessons

It is quite ambitious and I didn't get to play videogames today, so I'll have to look out for burnout or such.

Can't wait to see if I'll reach them, and to set my week 1 goals!

Goodnight xoxo

### Sunday 
I'm writing this at 7 AM on Monday because yesterday I felt knackered and went to sleep right after our guests left. I only had 3 hours overall to study - I was counting on that night's study session - and I only managed to reach my calculus theory study goal. 

Not too bad, I could just focus on exercises and Japanese today in order to reach yesterday's goals and do a little more, but I prefer not to: theory is a tough old bird.


## Goal setting for next week
Let's set the goals for the week to come!

I have 3 weeks and 3 days before the calculus exam, and to be honest, I would also like to try and attend a computer networks-related exam on the 17th. That'll be for later, I can easily cram it.

I have yet to study 23 groups of definitions and 25 theorems. I'd like to go fast this week because the workload of spaced repetition will get heavier and heavier as I go on - this will also be my only schedule-free week ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I'll go with 12 theorems and 9 groups of definitions, aka until lesson 26th of my textbook (note to future self).

In terms of exercises, I want to reach an "almost ready for the exam" level in limits, sequences, and series. I'll also practice some derivatives, even if I'll only find them in the study of functions.

I'll go soft on myself about Japanese because I sometimes get creative in how I interact with it. I'm starting to look at accurate and less interpretative translations of Japanese songs. So I'll just finish the first 2 chapters of Japanese from zero 1 and get confident about my hiragana knowledge.

That's all for week 0, see you in the next post :DDDD

Praying for you üïØÔ∏è O Great Mita üíù
