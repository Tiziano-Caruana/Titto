I created this site in a hot week of July in Rome, between the 11th and 14th.

I have always had the idea of creating a personal website just for myself, but I was convinced that you had to do something important in life to be able to publish one. A simple Tiziano Caruana could not do it, it was something for the President of the Republic and similar.

In the summer of 2021, after convincing myself that even I could afford it, I published my first site (also static and hosted on GitHub pages) very simple, single-page written in JavaScript and Bootstrap (ugh). 

The result did not seem bad to me, but the site was received with little enthusiasm from my friends and relatives, and I decided to take it down about a month later. Actually it was not very graphic, and it did not offer any type of important information about me (what did you want me to write, I was 15).

In the CTF community I found several personal sites that I liked a lot despite their minimalism. The extremely simple graphics did not distract from the player's style of writing, which is shown in the writeups and especially in the blogs.  

The idea of my ideal site is precisely this:
- Easy to maintain;  
- With contents that can entertain the interested niche (hello TRX);
- Fast and simple.

And here we are. Hugo ([the framework â†—](https://gohugo.io/)) helped me a lot. I would never have thought of having a first demo of the site in less than a day of programming (they don't sponsor me I SWEAR)

I still have to create the section for the [blog](https://tiziano-caruana.github.io/it/tags/blog) and for the [writeup](https://tiziano-caruana.github.io/it/tags/writeup), but I am confident that it will take me no more than half an hour (I have a workaround to do this thing in three seconds exploiting the tags) if all goes well.

So this site will be my protected area, my personal studio where I can publish writeups and write some articles on things that interest me or, why not, on my personal life (for better or for worse). It's been a while since I've been telling myself that I should start writing again, this is the perfect opportunity to do so.

See you next time.
