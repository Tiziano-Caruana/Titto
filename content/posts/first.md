If you're reading this post, know that you are one of the first to visit this site. I built the site while [productively procrastinating](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=productive%20procrastination)â†—. In a little while, I have to go out and tomorrow I won't be able to fix this stuff because I'll be busy all day.

Starting from the day after tomorrow, I will begin to add some content and sections to the site, and I would like to have a section dedicated to CTF writeups and a section dedicated to a sort of personal blog. We'll see.
